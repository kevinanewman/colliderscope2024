To run examples, very helpful:

import pyqtgraph.examples
pyqtgraph.examples.run()

Embedding widgets inside PyQt applications (WORKS!)

For the serious application developer, all of the functionality in pyqtgraph is available via widgets that can be
embedded just like any other Qt widgets. Most importantly, see: PlotWidget, ImageView, GraphicsLayoutWidget, and
GraphicsView. PyQtGraph’s widgets can be included in Designer’s ui files via the “Promote To…” functionality:

In Designer, create a QGraphicsView widget (“Graphics View” under the “Display Widgets” category).
Right-click on the QGraphicsView and select “Promote To…”.
Under “Promoted class name”, enter the class name you wish to use (“PlotWidget”, “GraphicsLayoutWidget”, etc).
Under “Header file”, enter “pyqtgraph”.
Click “Add”, then click “Promote”.
See the designer documentation for more information on promoting widgets. The “VideoSpeedTest” and
“ScatterPlotSpeedTest” examples both demonstrate the use of .ui files that are compiled to .py modules using pyuic5 or
pyside-uic. The “designerExample” example demonstrates dynamically generating python classes from .ui files (no pyuic5
/ pyside-uic needed).
